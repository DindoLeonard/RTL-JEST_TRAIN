# Backdrop to Test...

- more complex user interactions
  - multiple forms entry, moving through order phases
- mouseover popup
  - test that element disappears from DOM
- simulate server response
  - mock service worker
- async app updates
  - awaiting DOM changes
- global state via context

---

- We will not be testing context implementation

  - only interested in testing behavior as seen by user!
  - Test no different if we used Redux, Mobx, etc

- Only difference in the test setup
  - make sure component is wrapped in context
  - ensure functionality
  - avoid errors
