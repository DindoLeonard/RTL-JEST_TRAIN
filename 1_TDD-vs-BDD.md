# TDD vs BDD

- React Testing library encouranges testing behavior over implementation
- So shouldn't we be calling this BDD instead of TDD?

  - actually, no

- BDD is very explicitly defined
  - involves collaboration between lots of roles
    - developers, QA, business partners, etc
  - defines process for different groups to interact
- In this course, only developers, so TDD!

## if all developers

TDD - Technically Test Driven Development even if we're doing behavior
